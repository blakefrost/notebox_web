### It's Free

This is FREE Software! Free as in a frisbee you don't have to pay for, and
don't have to return. You can use it for anything conceivable. I don't suggest
using it for anything that your mother wouldn't approve of though. Please, code
responsibly, and think of how your actions affect others. Other than that, hope
it serves you well, and if you come up with any improvements, feel free to tap
me on the shoulder.
